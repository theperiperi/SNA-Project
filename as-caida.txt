The dataset you shared is the CAIDA Autonomous Systems (AS) graph collected on November 5, 2007. It represents a snapshot of the Internet‚Äôs structure at the level of Autonomous Systems (AS).

üß† What is an Autonomous System (AS)?
An Autonomous System is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of a single organization that presents a unified routing policy to the Internet. Examples include Internet Service Providers (ISPs), large corporations, and educational institutions.

üìä What does this dataset represent?
Nodes (n = 26,475): Each node represents an Autonomous System (AS).
Edges (m = 53,381): An edge between two nodes indicates communication (i.e., a direct routing relationship) between two ASes.
Undirected Graph: If AS1 connects to AS2, AS2 also connects back to AS1 (symmetric communication).
Unweighted Graph: All edges are treated equally, meaning there are no bandwidth or traffic volume differences recorded.
No Loops: An AS does not connect to itself.
No Multiple Edges: There is only one edge between any two connected ASes.
üìè Key Graph Characteristics
Network Size:

Nodes (n) = 26,475 (ASes)
Edges (m) = 53,381 (Connections)
Degree Distribution:

Maximum Degree (dmax) = 2,628 (Most connected AS)
Average Degree (d) = 4.03 (Each AS connects to ~4 other ASes on average)
Degree Assortativity (œÅ) = ‚àí0.194 (Slightly disassortative, meaning high-degree nodes prefer to connect to low-degree nodes)
Connectivity:

Largest Connected Component (LCC): Includes all 26,475 nodes (graph is fully connected).
Diameter (Œ¥) = 17 (Longest shortest path between any two nodes).
Effective Diameter:
50th percentile (Œ¥0.5) = 3.4 (Half of all node pairs can be reached in ~3.4 hops).
90th percentile (Œ¥0.9) = 4.6 (90% of node pairs can be reached in ~4.6 hops).
Clustering:

Clustering Coefficient (c) = 0.0073 (Low clustering; ASes are not densely interconnected).
Power Law Distribution:

Exponent (Œ≥) = 2.51 (The graph follows a power-law degree distribution, meaning a few nodes (ASes) are highly connected, while most have very few connections).
üîç Why is this dataset important?
Internet Topology Research: Understanding the structure of the Internet at the AS level.
Routing Analysis: Analyzing how information flows between different autonomous systems.
Network Resilience: Studying how robust the Internet is against failures or attacks.
Graph Theory Applications: Modeling large-scale networks and testing algorithms on real-world graphs.
